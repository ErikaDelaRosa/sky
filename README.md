this is the sky exercise 
This is exercise is about;Sky app,
Bild a webpage will give the feeling to the user that  in the sky and remember in the sky you will find some birds flying and many clouds :cloud:
keep on mind your clouds will move around and for sure the birds do that too.
the user should see that when he/she browsing this webpage.

How I made it? 
I have chose different gifs following the sky topic, and try to harmonize them together. To create harmony between them, I had to pay attention to the size, locate them properly on the page, and set the right order.
As I have code every property in one line, the order is very important. First the things that I can see closer, and last the things i can see further. 

On the img folder I have stored all the gifs I wanted to use, even if I didn't use them all. 

At the moment, the the paratrooper is not very well coordinated - as he should jump off the plane at the correct time, but we will fix this in the following lessons.
